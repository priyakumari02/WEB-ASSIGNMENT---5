        <h1>Undefined vs Not Defined </h1>
        <p>In JavaScript, undefined and not define both are related to memory space and there is a very little
            difference between them. If the variable name which is being accessed doesn’t exist in memory space then it
            would be not defined, and if exists in memory space but hasn’t been assigned any value till now, then it
            would be undefined.</p>

        <div class="explain">
            <div class="step_head">1. UNDEFINED </div>
            <ul>
                <pre>
                    eg: 
                        &lt;script>
                        var a;
                        console.log(a);
                        &lt;/script>
                        Output - UNDEFINED
                        </pre>
                <li>Memory is initialise but not allocated in that case JavaScript allocated undefined to it.</li>


                <li>
                    The first one is the memory allocation phase during this all the variables and function definitions
                    get stored inside the memory heap. The JavaScript assigns undefined to each variable in this phase.
                </li>
                <li>
                    UNDEFINED is a JavaScript keyword that has a special meaning. Everything which gets a space in
                    memory will contain undefined until we assign a value to that memory space.

                        console.log(b);

                    Memory is neither initialise nor allocated.

                <li>
                    In JavaScript, it is one of the reference errors that JavaScript will throw when someone accesses
                    the variable which is not inside the memory heap.

                <li>
                    A not defined is a variable that is not declared at a given point of time with declaration keyword
                    like var, let, or const.
